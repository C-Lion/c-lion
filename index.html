			<h2>SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h2>
			<hr class="grey" />
			<p class="bio">
				C-Lion is a software developer and HCI designer, specializing 
				in technical educational software and web applications. After
				designing an online math learning center for Mercy College and 
				teaching online computer science courses for the Michigan Jewish Institute,
				managing the the technical team for the deployment of a MOOC course
				and adminstering the NovoEd site for the Open Doors Group's MOOC course
				has been a more recent project. 
			</p>	
			<p class="bio">	These software applications are influenced by years of expertise
				as an electronics and maintenance technician keeping the runways open at 
				NYC's JFK and LaGuardia airports and maintaining a fleet of over 500 vehicles
				in a high state of readiness for the immediate deployment of a US Army 
				mobile general hospital. In both cases, there was a constant need for creating 
				new technical training, both in digital form and "on the job".
